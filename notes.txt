light up LEDs for corresponding keys as progress thru sheet music

whats the target audience?
people who canâ€™t read sheet music

need sequences bc can specify timing

each track typically contains the notes that a single instrument would play

The embedded raw MIDI message can be set only when constructing the MidiEvent

need transmitter and receiver objects

so i need to turn a song into a Track

the keyboard is a sequencer

midichannel?

MidiSystem
can translate MIDI file to Sequence
 A MIDI input port transmits data from an external device to a Java Sound API Receiver, and likewise a MIDI output port receives data from a software object and relays the data to an external device

how do i obtain the keyboard device?
get info object, then
static MidiDevice getMidiDevice(MidiDevice.Info info)
make sure its suitable
access & reserve device by opening, then connect to other device to share data

the time stamp on a message sent to a device's Receiver object always measures absolute time in microseconds. specifically, it measures the number of microseconds elapsed since the device that owns the receiver was opened
check if device supports time stamps
